Git
-Version Control

Problem (Before GIT)
1. Sharing the work done by multiple person.
2. Problem with merging the code written by multiple programmers.
3. Accidental deletion of the project or project file recovery.
4. Going back to previous version is very difficult.
5. Code review is also difficult.

Git Setup in any project:
1. git init
2. git remote add origin <URL>
3. git add <file-name> or git add .
4. git commit -am "<Message>"
5. git push origin <branch-name>

From 2nd Time (Whenever you are working alone):
1. git add <file-name> or git add .
2. git commit -am "<Message>"
3. git push origin <branch-name>

If multiple people are working on same git repo :
1. git add <file-name> or git add .
2. git commit -am "<Message>"    => working tree clean
3. git pull origin <branch-name>
if conflict then :
    1. Solve the conflict
    2. git status
    if git status doesn't show working tree clean
        1. git commit -am "<Message>"
4. git push origin <branch-name>
